# COSS

(this repo is a work in progress)

__Component Oriented Style Sheets__

While building a large-scale application, it is really important to structure the css code in a maintainable way. But large-scale applications were once small applications and managing, mantaining and structuring the the css was not a problem. There are Methodologies for building css like BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS or Atomic. All of them are really helful if implemented since the beginning but they are not really handy when the css has no structure and counts more than 10k lines.

In Modomoto we came up with the idea of __COSS - Component Oriented Style Sheets__ framework. 

__COSS__ is a way of rethinking, refactoring and building our css code base.
